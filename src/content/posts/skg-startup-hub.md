Thessaloniki is the biggest European city before Asia, it lays on the coastline of Thermaikos gulf and inhabits around 1 million people. The city is founded in 315 B.C. and named after the sister of Alexander the Great. Throughout the centuries it has been home for many cultures including Greeks, Turks, Jews and Romans. Any of them left a twist so that you can hardly not feel at home.


Tech startups that grow here develop products and services mainly for the web, using SaaS business models. Great cases of local products are [**Book’n’Bloom**](https://booknbloom.com/), [**Goodvidio**](https://goodvid.io/) and [**SchooX**](https://schoox.com/). Why they are here? Well, they are taking advantage of the everyday human environment, the comparatively low wages, the endless talent pool of creative locals, and other opportunities such as our world class tech conference [**Devit**](http://devitconf.org/) that happens here every May.


Unlike Greek macroeconomics, the local tech scene grows; outperforming the traditional super cool pace of doing stuff here in Thessaloniki. Tech communities have increased exponentially over the past years and individual professionals decided to work remotely, living in a calm and highly creative environment.


## **Heading To Thessaloniki**


Keep in mind that the coolest thing you can find here, is the air that makes you super productive and lets you connect with peers easily. Thessaloniki is built to help you attend community meetups without having to change 3 shuttle buses. One realizes that everything is set to facilitate the growth of a prolific tech hub.


## **Advantages To Start A Business In This City:**

- The city is set on the crossroad of Europe and Asia. It welcomes businesses who want to connect those markets. It is actually the closest to the Asian markets, European city. Istanbul is just a 6 hours car ride.
- Aristotle University, 230,000 m² in the center of the city, has more than 100.000 students. Along with other institutions Thessaloniki has a constant wheelpower of almost 200.000 tertiary educated people seeking to make their next step.
- City center is 20 minutes from the airport and all major venues are located downtown. You can go on foot almost everywhere.
- Set-up and operating costs are low. You can legally set-up a P.C.(private company) – with an initial share capital of €1. Then you’ll need around €500 for insurance, legal and accounting per month.
- The startup community is in the building so you can always contribute your pebble doing something that adds value. Locals will be on your side.

### **Things To Consider**

- As you probably know Greece is in this famous crisis.
    - Tax Rate is 29%(x2), as you also deposit your taxes for the next operating year, while VAT is 24%.
    - There is lack of capital here. What you do in Thessaloniki is build your product without distractions and travel to find capital for your business. Famous startup destinations for the capital quest are [**Athens**](https://magazine.startus.cc/athens-is-where-future-is-all-about-startups/), [**London**](https://magazine.startus.cc/london-startup-city-guide/) and [**Berlin**](https://magazine.startus.cc/berlin-startup-city-guide/). Plane tickets are inexpensive and there are also low budget airlines, so travelling often is quite affordable.
- Although it takes 3-5 days to legally establish a company, we are still at the age of stamps and paper. I sometimes believe, that there might not be heavier public office processes on planet earth and that’s why I always pay someone to represent me.
- You cannot find big tech companies’ HQs here, except [**BETA CAE**](http://www.beta-cae.com/) that started local and grew global.
- There is a possibility that you tell people you are building a tech startup and they stare at you like you are an alien.

## **Dive Into Thessaloniki’s Vibrant Community**

## **Get Started At A Co-working Space In Thessaloniki**


So after attending some of our awesome meetups as well as our annual conferences you are fully inspired and would like a place to work. Here is where to go. Traditional open co-workings as well as closed offices and of course Thessaloniki’s hackerspace. Have a look at the following:

- [**Coho, The co-working home**](http://www.coho.gr/home/en/) – The place to be the incubator of your success. It provides business facilities and services tailored to your needs. This is the traditional, collaboration, business development and shared workspace, in the center of Thessaloniki.

## **Take Care Of Your Finances In Thessaloniki**


We are still at the the early stage. Thessaloniki is not, yet, the place that capital firms have strong presence. However, we do have some Greek VCs based in Athens with [**Venture Friends**](http://venturefriends.co/) being the most active lately. Then [**Openfund**](http://theopenfund.com/), [**Odyssey**](http://odysseyvp.com/) and the [**PJ tech catalyst**](http://www.pjtechcatalyst.com/), also based in Athens, are usually looking to invest part of their whole fund in companies of northern Greece.


Other capital sources may be local and national startup competitions such as the [**John and Mary Pappajohn Business Plan Award**](http://www.act.edu/index.jsp?CMCCode=804303&extLang=LG) provided, along with [**Venture Garden**](http://www.venturegarden.gr/en/home), by the American college of Thessaloniki, [**ennovation**](http://www.ennovation.eu/), a student competition co-organized by local universities, [**i-bank**](https://www.nbg.gr/en/nbgseeds/competition/) and the [**Hellenic Initiative**](https://www.thehellenicinitiative.org/).


Frankly speaking, Thessaloniki is the city where you can develop your product with no distractions having the opportunity to join several cool community meetups, mingle with like minded people and add value to your organization. We are kinda poor regarding local funding opportunities but, you can always set-up your company in a more investor friendly country while keeping your development and operations departments here.


## **Get Further Advice In Thessaloniki**


[**OKthess**](http://www.okthess.gr/), a space for early stage entrepreneurs where you can get further advice on your idea, business model and funding opportunities is in the building. Apart from that, Thessaloniki is small and connected. So the best place to seek for advice is the community itself. People can guide you to the right meetup, person and/or place. You could also join the pages mentioned above but what it works in Thessaloniki better is the word of mouth channel.


You’d like something more specific eh? [**SKGTech**](http://skgtech.io/) people got you covered! They have already created a 250+ people Slack community. Get your [**personal invitation**](http://skgtech.io/#slack-invite), explore the channels and get me online to ask for more information.


Ready for Thessaloniki?
