## **Summary**


Dummy-D offers the most relaxing space traveling experience around the globe. Our Spacecrafts are developed to make travelers feel like home providing one of a kind features such as internet, sofas on-board and jacuzzi. We’ve been working on our product for a year now, using our own capital and are currently searching 40.000.000 drachmas to make the business roll. We already have some customer attention, manifested via pre-booked tickets; however, success is calculated on fully deposited bookings, starting from 1st January 2050.


## **Team**


We met each other 10 years ago at the university. Our goal is to create a modern company where any professional would love to work.

### **Geotargeting**


More than half of space travelers are Africans with ~50% of them being Malawians.

Later on, Latin American and Chinese markets will also be targeted.

| Dummy-D | 5       | 5        | 3     | 13    |
| Space-X | 4       | 5        | 4     | 13    |
| Laika   | 3       | 5        | 5     | 13    |


On one hand Dummy-D outperforms competitive players by being far more comforting. On the other hand, ticket price is higher than the market average as relaxation services addition results to higher production costs. As the totals reveal, we enter the market offering an equivalent to traditional market leaders product.
